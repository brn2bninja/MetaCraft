This code implements a user-friendly software that generates a variety of metalens designs based on the user preferences. The design of metalenses involves the time-wise and computationally expensive tasks of searching for the appropriate components. Additionally, designers must ensure that the generated designs are compatible with fabrication capabilities, given that optical metalenses consist of nanoscale structures and elements.
The current version comprises six rcwa results of meta-atom groups.
